		Some parts of this chapter were originally published in or adapted from:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] \cite{DeSIRe} \bibentry{DeSIRe} (presented in \Secref{sec:desire})
			\item[] \cite{AdvSInvConf} \bibentry{AdvSInvConf} (presented in \Secref{sec:adv_signer_inv})
			\item[] \cite{AdvSInvJournal} \bibentry{AdvSInvJournal} (idem)
			\item[] \cite{AdvInvAttack} \bibentry{AdvInvAttack} (\Secref{sec:adv_inv_attack})
		\end{itemize}
		
		The first two authors contributed equally in \cite{DeSIRe} and \cite{AdvSInvConf}. Both conceived the models and designed and conducted the experiments, with the supervision of Rebelo and Cardoso. The work in \cite{AdvSInvJournal} extends \cite{AdvSInvConf} by including a more exhaustive experimental evaluation. In \cite{AdvInvAttack}, Diogo Pernes contributed on the development of the proposed methodology, together with the first two authors, who formalized the problem and conducted all experiments. Cardoso supervised the work.
