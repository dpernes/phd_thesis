	abstract = { Despite the growing popularity of 802.11 wireless networks, users often suffer from connectivity problems and performance issues due to unstable radio conditions and dynamic user behavior, among other reasons. Anomaly detection and distinction are in the thick of major challenges that network managers encounter. The difficulty of monitoring broad and complex Wireless Local Area Networks, that often requires heavy instrumentation of the user devices, makes anomaly detection analysis even harder. In this paper we exploit 802.11 access point usage data and propose an anomaly detection technique based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Universal Background Model (UBM) on data that is inexpensive to obtain. We then generate a number of network anomalous scenarios in OMNeT++/INET network simulator and compare the detection outcomes with those in baseline approaches—RawData and Principal Component Analysis. The experimental results show the superiority of HMM and HMM-UBM models in detection precision and sensitivity. }

	abstract = "A hybrid approach combining the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is presented. The Self-Organizing Hidden Markov Model Map (SOHMMM) establishes a cross-section between the theoretic foundations and algorithmic realizations of its constituents. The respective architectures and learning methodologies are fused in an attempt to meet the increasing requirements imposed by the properties of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and protein chain molecules. The fusion and synergy of the SOM unsupervised training and the HMM dynamic programming algorithms bring forth a novel on-line gradient descent unsupervised learning algorithm, which is fully integrated into the SOHMMM. Since the SOHMMM carries out probabilistic sequence analysis with little or no prior knowledge, it can have a variety of applications in clustering, dimensionality reduction and visualization of large-scale sequence spaces, and also, in sequence discrimination, search and classification. Two series of experiments based on artificial sequence data and splice junction gene sequences demonstrate the SOHMMM’s characteristics and capabilities."

	abstract="This paper presents a series of new results for domain adaptation in the regression setting. We prove that the discrepancy is a distance for the squared loss when the hypothesis set is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by a universal kernel such as the Gaussian kernel. We give new pointwise loss guarantees based on the discrepancy of the empirical source and target distributions for the general class of kernel-based regularization algorithms. These bounds have a simpler form than previous results and hold for a broader class of convex loss functions not necessarily differentiable, including Lqlosses and the hinge loss. We extend the discrepancy minimization adaptation algorithm to the more significant case where kernels are used and show that the problem can be cast as an SDP similar to the one in the feature space. We also show that techniques from smooth optimization can be used to derive an efficient algorithm for solving such SDPs even for very high-dimensional feature spaces. We have implemented this algorithm and report the results of experiments demonstrating its benefits for adaptation and show that, unlike previous algorithms, it can scale to large data sets of tens of thousands or more points.",

	abstract = 	 {Faced with distribution shift between training and test set, we wish to detect and quantify the shift, and to correct our classifiers without test set labels. Motivated by medical diagnosis, where diseases (targets), cause symptoms (observations), we focus on label shift, where the label marginal p(y) changes but the conditional p(x| y) does not. We propose Black Box Shift Estimation (BBSE) to estimate the test distribution p(y). BBSE exploits arbitrary black box predictors to reduce dimensionality prior to shift correction. While better predictors give tighter estimates, BBSE works even when predictors are biased, inaccurate, or uncalibrated, so long as their confusion matrices are invertible. We prove BBSE’s consistency, bound its error, and introduce a statistical test that uses BBSE to detect shift. We also leverage BBSE to correct classifiers. Experiments demonstrate accurate estimates and improved prediction, even on high-dimensional datasets of natural images.}

	abstract = {A word sense disambiguation (WSD) system trained on one domain and applied to a different domain will show a decrease in performance. One major reason is the different sense distributions between different domains. This paper presents novel application of two distribution estimation algorithms to provide estimates of the sense distribution of the new domain data set. Even though our training examples are automatically gathered from parallel corpora, the sense distributions estimated are good enough to achieve a relative improvement of 56% when incorporated into our WSD system.},

	abstract = {A class of predictive densities is derived by weighting the observed samples in maximizing the log-likelihood function. This approach is effective in cases such as sample surveys or design of experiments, where the observed covariate follows a different distribution than that in the whole population. Under misspecification of the parametric model, the optimal choice of the weight function is asymptotically shown to be the ratio of the density function of the covariate in the population to that in the observations. This is the pseudo-maximum likelihood estimation of sample surveys. The optimality is defined by the expected Kullback–Leibler loss, and the optimal weight is obtained by considering the importance sampling identity. Under correct specification of the model, however, the ordinary maximum likelihood estimate (i.e. the uniform weight) is shown to be optimal asymptotically. For moderate sample size, the situation is in between the two extreme cases, and the weight function is selected by minimizing a variant of the information criterion derived as an estimate of the expected loss. The method is also applied to a weighted version of the Bayesian predictive density. Numerical examples as well as Monte-Carlo simulations are shown for polynomial regression. A connection with the robust parametric estimation is discussed.}

The survey covers the different facets of concept drift in an integrated way to reflect on the existing scattered state of the art.

	abstract = "Land use classification requires a significant amount of labeled data, which may be difficult and time consuming to obtain. On the other hand, without a sufficient number of training samples, conventional classifiers are unable to produce satisfactory classification results. This paper aims to overcome this issue by proposing a new model, TrCbrBoost, which uses old domain data to successfully train a classifier for mapping the land use types of target domain when new labeled data are unavailable. TrCbrBoost adopts a fuzzy CBR (Case Based Reasoning) model to estimate the land use probabilities for the target (new) domain, which are subsequently used to estimate the classifier performance. Source (old) domain samples are used to train the classifiers of a revised TrAdaBoost algorithm in which the weight of each sample is adjusted according to the classifier’s performance. This method is tested using time-series SPOT images for land use classification. Our experimental results indicate that TrCbrBoost is more effective than traditional classification models, provided that sufficient amount of old domain data is available. Under these conditions, the proposed method is 9.19% more accurate."

    abstract = "Deep domain adaptation has emerged as a new learning technique to address the lack of massive amounts of labeled data. Compared to conventional methods, which learn shared feature subspaces or reuse important source instances with shallow representations, deep domain adaptation methods leverage deep networks to learn more transferable representations by embedding domain adaptation in the pipeline of deep learning. There have been comprehensive surveys for shallow domain adaptation, but few timely reviews the emerging deep learning based methods. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of deep domain adaptation methods for computer vision applications with four major contributions. First, we present a taxonomy of different deep domain adaptation scenarios according to the properties of data that define how two domains are diverged. Second, we summarize deep domain adaptation approaches into several categories based on training loss, and analyze and compare briefly the state-of-the-art methods under these categories. Third, we overview the computer vision applications that go beyond image classification, such as face recognition, semantic segmentation and object detection. Fourth, some potential deficiencies of current methods and several future directions are highlighted."

An analysis of the discriminatory properties of our proposed eigenspace Size Function shows a significant improvement in performance when compared to the original unmodified Size Function. We describe our support vector machine based recognition framework which uses a combination of our eigenspace Size Function and Hu moments features to classify different hand postures. Experiments, based on two different hand posture data sets, show that our method is robust at recognizing hand postures independent of the person performing them. Our method also performs well compared to other user independent hand posture recognition systems."

To separate hand images from complex backgrounds, we use skin colour and texture attributes with neural networks. The recognition process is based on the combination of three shape descriptors: Discrete orthogonal Tchebichef moments applied on both internal and external outlines hand, Hu moments and a set of geometric features derived from the convex hull that encloses the hand shape taking into account the hand orientation. The recognition is carried out using KNN and SVM classifiers. The proposed descriptors are combined in several sequential and parallel manners and applied on different datasets. The obtained results are compared to existing works."

    abstract="Sign Language Recognition (SLR) has become one of the most important research areas in the field of human computer interaction. SLR systems are meant to automatically translate sign language into text or speech, in order to reduce the communicational gap between deaf and hearing people. The aim of this paper is to exploit multimodal learning techniques for an accurate SLR, making use of data provided by Kinect and Leap Motion. In this regard, single-modality approaches as well as different multimodal methods, mainly based on convolutional neural networks, are proposed. Our main contribution is a novel multimodal end-to-end neural network that explicitly models private feature representations that are specific to each modality and shared feature representations that are similar between modalities. By imposing such regularization in the learning process, the underlying idea is to increase the discriminative ability of the learned features and, hence, improve the generalization capability of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that multimodal learning yields an overall improvement in the sign recognition performance. In particular, the novel neural network architecture outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods for the SLR task.",

Our system does not need a separate segmentation stage but closely integrates finding the object boundaries with posture classification."

    abstract="There is an undeniable communication problem between the Deaf community and the hearing majority. Innovations in automatic sign language recognition try to tear down this communication barrier. Our contribution considers a recognition system using the Microsoft Kinect, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and GPU acceleration. Instead of constructing complex handcrafted features, CNNs are able to automate the process of feature construction. We are able to recognize 20 Italian gestures with high accuracy. The predictive model is able to generalize on users and surroundings not occurring during training with a cross-validation accuracy of 91.7{\%}. Our model achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.789 in the ChaLearn 2014 Looking at People gesture spotting competition.",
